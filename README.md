These are .js files.
It's for the easing of coding.
I've been using shortcuts so I won't have any problems.
It includes these files:

- sciMainBeta.js (less code; contains syntaxHighlighter function)

## PROJECT CODE FILES

- sciElements.js (for HTML Elements)

## INFO FILES

- SOURCES.md (containing sources) because I give thanks
