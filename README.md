These are .js files.
It's for the easing of coding.
I've been using shortcuts so I won't have any problems.
It includes these files:

## MAIN CODE FILES
- sciMainAlpha.js (the main file: full of get and set codes, togglers, math and more)
- sciMainBeta.js (less code; contains syntaxHighlighter function)

## PROJECT CODE FILES
- SCI2D.js (for 2D projections)
- sciElements.js (for HTML Elements)

## INFO FILES
