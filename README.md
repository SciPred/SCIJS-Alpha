# SCIJS-Alpha
These files are for improvement. Some are still in beta mode :)
Please note that these files are for the good of shortcuts (or bad?) and to make coding easier.
Still trying to update everyday for anyone who sees this :)

## VERSIONS (for sciMainAlpha.js)
---
### v1.0000
- sciMain separated into BETA (unorganized) and ALPHA. However, syntaxHighlighter is only in BETA because of a few bugs. :/
- BETA functions were put on top of ALPHA file
